 * threadPool.h
 *
 * Simple implementation of a "dynamic thread pool" with a
 * "bounded queue" of tasks to run.  Uses POSIX threads
 * (pthread) to process incoming tasks with minimal
 * re-creation of the threads when needed.
 *
 * Threads that are created past the 'min' will eventually
 * expire when there is nothing to process for several seconds.
