 * Helper utility to perform a task in a background thread,
 * after waiting for an initial period of time.
 *
 * NOTE: uses the concept of 'handles' vs 'objects' due to
 * the nature of tasks executing and releasing in the background.
 * this prevents memory issues with the caller having a pointer
 * to an object that may have been released in the background.
