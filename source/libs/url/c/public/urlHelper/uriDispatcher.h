 * uriDispatcher.h
 *
 * Use a "trie" data-structure as a mechanism to breakdown URI paths,
 * providing a way to process URIs that can have wildcard variables and
 * callback-handlers.  Primarily created to support REST calls, which is
 * why this is tailored for those URIs.  Some example URIs that this can
 * process include (wildcards are depicted with surrounding [] brackets):
 *
 *  1 - /icontrol/sites/[siteId]/network/cameras/[cameraId]
 *  2 - /icontrol/sites/[siteId]/network/rules/[ruleId]
 *  3 - /icontrol/sites/[siteId]/network/zdif/discover
 *
 * Before this can process URIs, it first must be created and primed with
 * callback-handlers for the various templates (the examples above).  As
 * these handlers are inserted into the structure, it will build an internal
 * trie.  Using our examples above, the trie would look something like:
 *
 *         icontrol
 *            |
 *          sites
 *            |
 *         [*var*]
 *            |
 *         network
 *          / | \
 *         /  |  \
 *       cam  |  zdif
 *       /   rules \
 *      /     |     \
 *   [*var*]  |  discover
 *            |
 *         [*var*]
 *
 * limitations and conventions:
 *  - each node of the tree can have 0-n children
 *  - each node can only have 1 "variable" child
 *  - each node can be a callback-handler notification
 *  - if a node has a "variable" child, will be stored as the first child (for optimization)
