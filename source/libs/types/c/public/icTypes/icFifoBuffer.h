/*-----------------------------------------------
 * icFifoBuffer.h
 *
 * Simplistic FIFO (First In - First Out) Buffer that
 * dynamically increases memory required to store an
 * undetermined amount of information.
 *
 * Similar to a queue, but intended for chunks of
 * contiguous memory (such as a stream).
 *
 * As data is realized, it can be appended to this buffer,
 * then read from the front.  Once enough data has been
 * read (pulled), it will attempt to cleanup the internal
 * storage to prevent an ever-growing buffer.
 *
 * Primarily used as a temporary memory storage area
 * when the buffering data between two different
 * components or threads.  Could be thought of as the
 * inner portion of a pipe.
 *
 * NOTE: this does not perform any mutex locking to
 *       allow for single-threaded usage without the
 *       overhead.  If locking is required, it should
 *       be performed by the caller
